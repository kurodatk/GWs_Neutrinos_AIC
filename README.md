GW and neutrino signals based on 3D AIC models.
For GWs, I output
#   t_pb[s]     Dh+(pole)[cm]     Dhx(pole)[cm]      Dh+(equ)[cm]      Dhx(equ)[cm]
where postbounce time t_pb [s], Dh [cm], where h+/x denote two polarized wave modes,
and 'pole' and 'equ' are for an observer along the pole (i.e. rotational axis) and the equator (x-axis, this time), respectively.

Regarding neutrino profiles, I output
#   t_pb[s]        <L_e>[B/s]       <L_ae>[B/s]        <L_x>[B/s]        <E_e>[MeV]       <E_ae>[MeV]        <E_x>[MeV]    L_e(pole)[B/s]   L_ae(pole\)[B/s]    L_x(pole)[B/s]    E_e(pole)[MeV]   E_ae(pole)[MeV]    E_x(pole)[MeV]     L_e(equ)[B/s]    L_ae(equ)[B/s]     L_x(equ)[B/s]     E_e(equ)[MeV]    E_\ae(equ)[MeV].    E_x(equ)[MeV]
L and E denote neutrino luminosity and mean energy, respectively.
Subindices "e", "ae", and "x" mean electron type, electron type anti-, and heavy lepton type neutrinos, respectively.
B=Bethe=10^51 erg and <...> represents 4pi averaged value.
